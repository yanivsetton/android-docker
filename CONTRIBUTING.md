## Accepting New SDK Licenses

Update the script [`android-sdk/license_acceptor.sh`](./android-sdk/license_accepter.sh) with the new agreement checksums.  Do not remove pre-existing license agreement acceptances.

If a new agreement is accepted, a file should be created in the directory [`EULA`](./EULA).  If there is an update, ensure the agreements contain a suffix with the timestamp in the format `-YYYYMMDD`.
